Terrorist-Popper is a simple 2D wave shooter built in the LibGDX and Box2D libraries.

Points are awarded for hitting the terrorists and when a terrorist balloon is popped and the terrorist hits the ground.
Points are deducted if a hostage is hit or a hostage balloon is popped and the terrorist hits the ground. There are three types of
terrorists:the small ones gives the most points while the tall one and the bomb-stapped one gives slightly less points. The bomb-strapped
one will also explode after a random amount of time, at which point all balloons on the screen a popped and characters close to the
explosion will go flying. If any of these flying hostages/terrorists hit the ground, points will be added/deducted accordingly.

The player has two minutes to get as many points as possible and a high score is recorded into the app automatically.

There are three main difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard) which dictate the speed at which the balloons pull the characters up the screen.
There is also a chaos mode which adds significantly more bomb-strapped terrorists.

The game is currently underconstruction using Android Studio and the gradle needs to be compiled to run on a tablet/phone/VM.
